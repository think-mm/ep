        Muktomona is a secular humanist organization that took its shape on the
        26th of May, 2001 from a discussion meeting organized by Avijit Roy (1972 -
        2015). Although Muktomona started as an online discussion circle, it has now
        evolved into a social movement through blogs, activism and research. Our
        central principles are exemplified by secular humanism, a thought process
        characterized by a belief in philosophical naturalism and humanism.
        Philosophical naturalism states reality consists of only natural things,
        there exists nothing supernatural that we can know of, and science remains
        the only venue to know the world. Humanism asserts human beings are simply
        natural elements of this natural world and the source and measure of all
        morality and values.

        In English, the literal dictionary translation of "Muktomona" is
        freethinker. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, freethinker is
        somebody "who forms opinions on the basis of reason independently of
        authority; especially : one who doubts or denies religious dogma." The
        Muktomonas or the freethinkers do not subscribe to any authoritative diktats
        and want to understand the world through methodological naturalism. They
        believe in the immortal words of the Roman poet Horace: Sapere aude (dare to
        know).
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who form ideas and opinions about the world on the basis of logic,
        science and humanism, and independently of authority, tradition, societal
        norms and established dogmas can be called the freethinkers. However, not all
        of them are members of the Muktomona Collective. Only those who have agreed
        with the rules of the Muktomona Collective and have become members of the
        Collective are called Muktomona.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who are considered the members of the Muktomona are atheists,
        agnostics, sceptics, humanists, and secularists. Can a believer be a
        Muktomona? If a believer can apply methodological naturalism, analyze
        phenomena on the basis of natural laws of science and philosophy, and be
        secular and humanist in outlook then he or she can be a Muktomona, but one
        has to remember that this is mostly a society of non-believers.
